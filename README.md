# sc_split_paper_data

##### Data included in the paper "Genotype-free demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA-seq"
http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/570614v1

##### Data were generated using the newly published tool scSplit
https://github.com/jon-xu/sc_split

##### Results in Table 1 were generated based on datasets for the paper Zheng et al, “Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells” (previously deposited to biorxiv)
